# Community-Detection-on-a-Spatial-Graph
This is a code to detect communities in a spatial random graph

There are two algorithms implemented - A GBG algorithm that is published in our paper, and an improved spectral synchronization 
algorithm that is not published, but empirically performs better.

To use the algorithm, run the S
